**Welcome** to our humble repository. It currently contains three of the many views to come. uBert is in its heart a ride-hailing service but we aspire for much, much more. We're also hard at work implementing the next-generation of färdtjänst ride-hailing to disrupt the stale industry it is now to make the world a better place.

**Our** core mission is to take people places, prioritizing the human experience first. This sentiment can be found in every nook and cranny of the app, and the people behind it.

## Getting started
You'll need a few things to get started hacking, the only pre-requisite is nodejs. To install and start the development:
* Install dependencies `npm install`
* Start another terminal window
* Run `npm start` in one, and `node app.js` in the other one
* Go to `http://localhost:8080` in a browser and get cracking!

**PS**: The customer view uses experimental web platform features, specifically some features only available in Chrome (I feel bad even talking about this as a firefox user). These features are available in Microsoft Edge and are stable there, but since testing was done on Firefox and Chrome it doesn't work for some reason. So stick to chrome, or firefox for a slightly lesser experience. Enabling experimental features in Chrome can be done by going to `chrome://flags/` and enabling "Experimental Web Platform features".
