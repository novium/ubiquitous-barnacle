Welcome to our humble repository. It currently contains three of the many views to come. uBert is in its heart a ride-hailing service but we aspire for much, much more. We're also hard at work implementing the next-generation of färdtjänst ride-hailing to disrupt the stale industry it is now to make the world a better place.

Our core mission is to take people places, prioritizing the human experience first. This sentiment can be found in every nook and cranny of the app, and the people behind it.
