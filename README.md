## Getting started

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org)
2. Clone or download (and unzip) this repo
3. Navigate to the resulting folder in a command line tool (you know that you are in the right folder if it contains the file structure above)
4. Type `npm install` and wait while magic is installing the necessary libraries, which are specified in the file package.json (Don't worry about the npm warning at the end: "No repository field")
5. Type `node app.js` to start the server
6. Use a web browser to check what is happening at `localhost:3000`
7. Use another web browser to check what is happening at `localhost:3000`
8. Use another device to check what is happening at `<your IP address>:3000` (for this you may need to adjust your computer's firewall to allow connections to Node)

That should be enough to get started. Happy tinkering!
